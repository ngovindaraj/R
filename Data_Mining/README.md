Data Mining - Supervised Learning Classifier
------------------------------------------------
-	Implemented a supervised learning classifier in R to detect any English alphabet with 96.80% accuracy, given some statistically significant attributes about each alphabet ([UCI Machine Learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition))
-	Contrasted the prediction accuracy of different classifiers for alphabet detection â€“ classification trees (CART), nearest neighbor classifier (kNN) and ensemble classifier (Random Forest)
